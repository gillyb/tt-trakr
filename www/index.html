			<p>
				Time Trakr is the tiny productivity app that doesn't get in your way.
				It has just the features you need, and doesn't have the features you don't!
			</p>
			<p>
				It works by tracking time of the tasks you're working on, and displaying the list
				for you to see how much time was spent on each task.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just type in a task and hit 'enter'. Then, start and stop the task whenever you want
				until you mark it 'done'.
			</p>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="header">What do I get in the free version of Time Trakr ?</div>
			<p>
				You get the full working app to try and play with as much as you want.
				After a while you might (which means you will) start getting annoying
				popups suggesting you buy the product.
				If you have nerves of steal you will still be able to use the program.

			<div class="header">Why should I buy Time Trakr ?</div>
			<p>
				I don't belong to a big organization trying to capitalize on the backs' of others.
				I'm just trying to be a productive programmer (hence this program I built) building
				some cool programs for fun, and	letting others enjoy my work in the process as well.
				If you think your work should be valued, then please try to value mine by chipping
				in a bit and buying it.
				I tried to put an honest price on this program - If you think it's wrong, then please
				feel free to contact me so we can reach an agreement. :)

				By purchasing this program you will get free updates to all newer versions if and
				whenever released. I will also answer all support emails and sincerely work hard to
				fix any bugs, if ever discovered.
